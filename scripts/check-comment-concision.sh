# block that's an outlier length for a single declaration, as a prompt to
# re-read it for content already covered elsewhere (design-principles.md's
# pointer rule) — it doesn't try to detect redundancy itself. THRESHOLD_LINES
# is calibrated against this repo's own real blocks, not a guess: the
# densest legitimate single-declaration comment found here is
# scripts/lint-templates.sh's 12-line j2lint_pass block, so the threshold
# sits comfortably above it to avoid crying wolf on this repo's normal
# (dense but non-redundant) style.
