# template-e2e

Live e2e sandbox render.

## Install

```sh
corepack enable  # once per machine — puts the pinned pnpm on PATH
pnpm install
```

Commit `pnpm-lock.yaml` with the initial commit — CI installs with
`--frozen-lockfile` and fails without it.

## Use

```sh
pnpm start       # run the app (tsx)
just test        # vitest
just typecheck   # tsc --noEmit (the only type check — vitest/tsx never check)
just fmt         # biome (the base's `format` verb owns markdown)
```

## Contributing

The contributor guide — workflow, commit rules, tooling, credentials — lives in
`AGENTS.md` (composed from your agent-config rules; generate it if it isn't
present yet). Architecture decisions live in
[`docs/adr/`](docs/adr/README.md). This README is the human front door and
points at those homes rather than restating them.
